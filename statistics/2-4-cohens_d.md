[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

> Cohen's *d* for effect size on **weight** of first vs non-first live births:
* -0.0886729270726

> Cohen's *d* for effect size on **pregnancy length** of first vs non-first live births:
* 0.0288790446544

> This fails to show a huge difference in weight or pregnancy length due to first vs non-first birth order. Both effect sizes are well below 1 standard deviation.

> If we had to pick, birth weight is more affected (larger absolute value). Cohen's *d* is negative, indicating that first born babies may have a slightly *lower* birth weight than non-first babies. But the effect size (less than 1/10 of a SD) is so small it could just be noise, and even if it was statistically significant it might be practically meaningless.
